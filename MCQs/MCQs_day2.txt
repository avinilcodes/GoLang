MCQs

1. What is the output of the following code block

package main
 
import "fmt"
 
func main() {
   s := sum(10, 20)
   if s != nil {
       fmt.Println(*s)
   }
}
 
func sum(num1, num2 int) (sum *int) {
   s := num1 + num2
   return &s
}
 
30(correct- as we are passing address of s to main function)
The program execution will not print anything on standard output
Build error
Runtime error



2. What is the output of the following program execution
package main
 
import (
   "fmt"
)
 
func main() {
   switch {
   case true:
       fmt.Println("In true case")
   case 1 < 2:
       fmt.Println("In conditional operation check case")
   case false:
       fmt.Println("In false case")
   default:
       fmt.Println("In default case")
   }
}


In true case(correct as we are passing true as case)
In conditional operation check case
Build error
Runtime error


Que 3. What is the output of the following code execution
package main
 
import (
   "fmt"
)
 
func main() {
   s := "GO"
   for _, val := range s {
       fmt.Println(val)
   }
}

G 
O
71(correct - as we are iterating using range and what it does is, it goes index,and value)
79
      C)  Build error
      D)  None of the above



Que 4. What is the output of the following code execution
package main
 
import (
   "fmt"
)
 
func main() {
   i := 0
   for i < 4 {
       i++
       if i == 2 {
           continue
       }
 
       fmt.Print(i)
   }
 
}
 

123
245
134(correct - as it will print 134)
None of the above











Que 5. What is the output of the following code execution
package main
 
import (
   "fmt"
)
 
func main() {
   i := 0
   for i < 4 {
       i++
       if i == 3 {
           break
       }
 
       fmt.Print(i)
   }
 
}

12(correct - as it will break at i==3)
23
124
None of the above


Que 6. What is the output of following code execution
package main
 
import "fmt"
 
func main() {
   done := false
   if done := true; done {
       fmt.Println(done)
   }
 
   fmt.Println(done)
}
 

true and true
false and false
true and false (correct- as we are assigning true to done and both dones are different) 
false and true




Que 7. What will be the output of the following code execution 
package main
 
import "fmt"
 
func main() {
   on := 1
   fmt.Println(on == true)
}
 

True
False
Build error(correct - mismatched typesl)
None of the above



Que 8. What will be the output of the following code execution 
package main
 
import "fmt"
 
func main() {
   str := "Hello"
   for s := range str {
       fmt.Printf("%v", s)
   }
}
 


01234(correct - as it will give only indexes)
72101108108111
Build error
None of the above



Que 9: When should you use a struct type?
For storing the same type of values
For adding an additional type of values in runtime
For combining different types in a single type to represent a concept (correct)
None of the above
 
Que 10. What will be the output of the following code execution
package main
 
import "fmt"
 
type movie struct {
   title, genre string
   rating       float64
   released     bool
}
 
func main() {
   var lineKing movie
   fmt.Printf("title: %v, rating: %v, released: %v", lineKing.title, lineKing.rating, lineKing.released)
}
 
title: , rating: 0, released: false(correct - as default value for string is “”, for float is 0 and for bool is false
Build error
Runtime error
None of the above
