MCQs

Que 1. What will be the output of the following code execution

package main

import "fmt"

var enabled bool = true

func main() {
   var enabled = false

   if enabled {
       fmt.Println("hey there... !")
       return
   }

   fmt.Println("make enabled true... !")
}

    A) compile-time error
    B) make enabled true... ! (correct - enabled is false in main)
    C) hey there... !
    D) None of the above


Que 2. What will be the output of the following code execution
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
   var enabled = true
   fmt.Println("hey there...!")
}


    A) compile-time error (correct - enabled declared but not used)
    B) hey there... !
    C) runtime error
    D) None of the above

Que 3. How many times you can use a package clause for a single source code file?
    A) Once (correct – it gives compile time error if we use more than one package clause)
    B) Multiple time
    C) Twice
    D) None of the above


Que 4. Which one is an executable package?
    A) package main with func main (correct – as package main tell compiler to make executable of the current program and execution starts from main)
    B) package Main with func Main 
    C) package exec with func exec
    D) None of the above


Que 5. What will be the output of the following code execution

package main

import "fmt"

const PI float64

func main() {
    PI = 3.14
    radius := 15.00
    area := radius * radius * PI
   
    fmt.Printf("The area of a circle is %v\n", area)
}


Compile-time error (correct – as global constant is not initialized as well as assigning value to const after declaration)
The area of a circle is 706.5
Run time error
None of the above





Que 6. What is true about go build command

    A) compiles the packages named by the import paths, along with their dependencies, but it does not install the results (correct)
    B) When compiling packages, the build ignores files that end in '_test.go'.
    C) When compiling a single non-main package, the build compiles the packages but discards the resulting object
    D) All of the above


Que 7. go install will compile and installs the packages named by the import paths in the directory named by the 
    A) GOBIN environment variable
    B) GOPATH environment variable (correct)
    C) GOROOT environment variable
    D) None of the above


Que 8. go fmt command is used to take care of most formatting issues
    A) TRUE  (correct)
    B) FALSE



Que 9. What will be the output following code execution
package main

import "fmt"

const PI float64 = 3.14

func main() {
   r := 15
   area := PI * r * r
   fmt.Printf("The area of circle is : \n", area)
}

    A) Compile-time error(correct – Mismatched types error)
    B) The area of a circle is 706.5()
    C) Run time error
    D) None of the above



Que 10. What will be the output of the following code execution
package main

import "fmt"

const PI float64 = 3.14

func main() {
   PI = 3.141
   r := 15.00
   area := PI * r * r
   fmt.Printf("The area of circle is : \n", area)
}


    E) Compile-time error(correct – as it is trying to reassign to a const variable)
    F) The area of a circle is 706.5
    G) Run time error
    H) None of the above
